%HMMTIMESEGMENT Timeseries segmentation by HMM
%
%     [HMM,PTH,COMB] = HMMTIMESEGMENT(X,N,MD,STOPCRIT,REG)
%
% Segment the timeseries X into segments with minimum duration MD.
% Each timepoint in the timeseries (of length T) can be a feature vector
% of length DIM. The total size of X should therefore be TxDIM.
% Initially the timeseries is split into N consequitive segments, each
% modeled by a single state in an HMM using a single Gaussian pdf. The
% Gaussian models per state are merged until the total (log-)likelihood
% does not improve anymore.
